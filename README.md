## Introduction

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library for creating and manipulating large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices in Python. It is essential for data science, machine learning, and scientific computations.

Created by Travis Oliphant in 2005, NumPy continues to be open-source and supported by a vibrant community.

## Key Features

* N-Dimensional Arrays (ndarray): Perform efficient operations on arrays.
* Mathematical Functions: Includes algebra, Fourier transforms, and random numbers.
* Optimized for Performance: Fast computations with optimized CPU operations.
* Integration with Other Libraries: Serves as a foundation for pandas, scikit-learn, and more.
